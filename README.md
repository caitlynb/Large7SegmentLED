# Large7SegmentLED
OpenSCAD files for a large 3D Printed 7 Segment LED

Good day!  This is the master file for the following two Thingiverse things:
<Insert 1>
<Insert 2>

The first thing uses the following parts:  DigitParts, DigitDiffusion, DigitCase
The second thing uses the following parts:  SegmentParts, SegmentDiffusion, SegmentCase

Because the two parts are similar, and share a lot of code, they are both in the .scad file.
